You literally have everything there is to want. Ang ganda na. Ang bait pa. Ang sexy pa. Ang ganda pa ulit. Ang cute pa. Ang ganda pa ulit. Ang thoughtful pa. Ang sweet. Ang caring. Ang ganda pa ulit. Praise be Jesus and Mary nalang talaga. \n\nAnd thank you for the posts too!! Jusq, I feel really really appreciated because you love me so so much!  I really am thankful for all the effort you put into your posts, and how sweet and happy we are in them. The funny thing is, we are even happier in reality.

And how cute it is that I get to create it with you. I never thought na a relationship could be this wholesome that we could even laugh about and talk about things like sex and all the naughty stuff.
