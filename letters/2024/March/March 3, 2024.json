I was amazed how your mom even knew things like love language (sinabi niya to nung kumakain tayo dinner tas nagulat ako kase alam niya yon haha). I am still in awe on the parking skills of your dad and I found it cute that he calls your mom \"tart\" (shortcut ng sweetheart). Your ate and kuya are really cool people too!!! They are really fun to be with and I enjoyed talking with them a lot.\n\nLooking back, why wouldn't they be cool and amazing and kind? After all, they're the family of the girl I love. Part of your character and personality is a product of them being a huge part of your life. \n\nI like your family Rei! I'm really really glad I got to meet them! And I'm even more excited of how they'll be a huge part too of our story moving forward into the future! \n\nThank you so much Rei, for deeming me worthy of being introduced to your family!!!! I love you so much!!! I promise I won't break your heart and I'll take care of you and I'll cherish you forever!!! Wala ka ng choice, gusto nako ng mama mo HAHAHAHHAAH ipon na daw tayo kasal HAHAHAHAHAH. Mwaaa!!! \n\n","title":"March 3, 2024","userEditedTimestampUsec":1709455871265000,"createdTimestampUsec":1709437292373000,"textContentHtml":"<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height:1.38;margin-top:0.0pt;margin-bottom:0.0pt;\"><span style=\"font-size:16.0pt;font-family:'Google Sans';color:#000000;background-color:transparent;font-weight:400;font-style:normal;font-variant:normal;text-decoration:none;vertical-align:baseline;white-space:pre;white-space:pre-wrap;\">---family visit---<\/span><\/p><br /><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height:1.38;margin-top:0.0pt;margin-bottom:0.0pt;\"><span style=\"font-size:16.0pt;font-family:'Google Sans';color:#000000;background-color:transparent;font-weight:400;font-style:normal;font-variant:normal;text-decoration:none;vertical-align:baseline;white-space:pre;white-space:pre-wrap;\">Yesterday I got to visit your house for the first time!!!
