The contents of this letter are things that we have already talked about before, but I honestly think that they are too important to not be put into words. \n\nFirst, let's talk about my anxiety. I've told you before that I sometimes experience attacks even on just small inconsequential things and sometimes I still do. Sometimes they're even related to you. And sometimes you can help me with my overthinking (and I never hesitate to ask and you never fail to help me. Thank you so much Rei. For always being to open to these weird random questions of mine. I love you so much and I'm so lucky to have you). But sometimes, there are battles that I choose to and need to fight on my own. Because I'm just stubborn sometimes lol hahahahaha. But on those times, knowing that you have my back, knowing that you can take care of my heart, that you'll value my trust, and that you'll always prioritize my peace of mind, helps me fight my overthinking phases. It gives me solace that sometimes I don't need to find the solution or the reason that I'm looking for. I just need to trust you. And you'll take care of me. I talked about these things with you when we were at greenfields last Wednesday, and you were very receptive and you always comforted me then. Thank you very very very very much Rei. Tas kiniss mo pako non oh diba. HsjakKskdksksks. Achk. Kileg.\n\nThen, let's talk about you, or rather, us. I would like to once again thank you, Rei, for entrusting me with your firsts. I know it's a big deal for you, and I promise you that it's very much a big deal for me as well. It's a huge responsibility that I embrace and want. I feel really grateful for it and I would never do anything to make you regret it. I admit, some insecure part of me is telling me I'm not worthy of it.  But I promise you I'll prove myself worthy of you! I'll protect you Rei. I'll cherish and love you forever. I'll always put you first and I'll never knowingly put you in situations where you are uncomfortable and you're not feeling safe. So once again, thank you for your trust.
