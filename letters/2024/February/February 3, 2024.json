It hasn't even been 24 hours since we were last together. 24 hrs ago (by the time I'm writing this), we were watching our first movie together at the cinema. \n\nThat moment will remain one of my most treasured memories forever. \n\nI kept staring at your face though. I couldn't help it. You are so beautiful and perfect and I can't help but adore you, Rei. The most beautiful painting in the world could be in front of me, but I'll still choose to look at you. \n\nIt's not just because you are beautiful though, it's also because whenever I look at you, I also see and envision the future we could have together, and I couldn't help but drown in all of the possibilities. \n\nThough tbh, a big part of it is really just because you are very very very beautiful. mwaaa.\n\nYou're currently at the concert while I'm writing this and I said I'll read a book to keep myself entertained while you're busy (i got tired cleaning the house though, bwisit na bwisita), but while reading, my mind just goes back and goes back to the memories of yesterday. The aftereffects really do hit hard.\n\nI miss your kisses. I miss kissing you. I miss looking at you and seeing the woman of my dreams. I miss talking to you. I miss all your intelligent input. I miss you baby voice, how cute and sweet it is. \n\nWe also had our first kiss yesterday!!!!! I still couldn't believe i kissed you. Whenever I look back at the moment I couldn't help but experience a shiver of joy (and kilig). I kissed you. I've wanted to do it but I was holding back because I wanted to find the most romantic timing possible, and when the opportunity presented itself, I mustered up all my courage and did it. Your lips where so soft. I love kissing you. I'll kiss you over and over again. Magsawa ka. Bleh. Mwaa. Kith.\n\nBut more importantly, we've said our I love you's to each other yesterday!!!!! FINALLY!!! I've been holding back for a long time because liking you and missing you is just not enough to express my feelings for you. It just felt right to tell you I love you. I became sure that I loved you yesterday. I don't care about time anymore. I love you. I'll continue to love you. And I'll love you even harder. I'll express it through my words, but also through my actions. Because honestly? Telling you I love you is still not enough. I'll just show you I love you. I want to make you feel loved by me. \n\nLastly, thank you for loving me back, Rei. I love you, my dearest.\n","title":"February 3, 2024","userEditedTimestampUsec":1706946650339000,"createdTimestampUsec":1706945775576000,"textContentHtml":"<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height:1.38;margin-top:0.0pt;margin-bottom:0.0pt;\"><span style=\"font-size:16.0pt;font-family:'Google Sans';color:#000000;background-color:transparent;font-weight:400;font-style:normal;font-variant:normal;text-decoration:none;vertical-align:baseline;white-space:pre;white-space:pre-wrap;\">---aftereffects 2---<\/span><\/p><br /><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height:1.38;margin-top:0.0pt;margin-bottom:0.0pt;\"><span style=\"font-size:16.0pt;font-family:'Google Sans';color:#000000;background-color:transparent;font-weight:400;font-style:normal;font-variant:normal;text-decoration:none;vertical-align:baseline;white-space:pre;white-space:pre-wrap;\">Guess what.
