The past month has been super happy and filled with memories that I'll treasure for the rest of my life, and you are the root cause of it! Pero sa totoo lang, I've felt the sugar rush ever since I started talking to you. \n\nI'm really really thankful for you and I promise that in this world of boys, I'll always be a gentleman for u! And it's always worth it kase whenever I'm with you, I always feel like I'm in Cloud 9. Bc after all, you are someone as beautiful and charming as Aphrodite, and you are in love with me! Huhuhu. Sa tingin ko talaga, nagaya lang ata kita kase who am I to deserve someone like you. I'm just a line without a hook.\n\nPero anyways, tama na pa sad boy BWAHAHAHAHA CHZ. I'll never get tired of our electrifying love bby! Yung love story naten na mala-romcom sa cuteness hahaha. I really find it charming and magical how we have tons of invisible strings that all lead us up to each other. Those strings help me feel at peace and make me feel fearless whenever I'm with you kase they make me feel na we're really meant for each other.\n\nI really can't wait for the day na i-introduce mo tayong dalawa using the line: \"Me and my husband\" katapos natin dumaan sa pasilyo ng simbahan. PERO! Kahit na di pa dumarating yung araw na yon, we're already glued together bby! Nu ba! Di na kita papakawalan! You've enchanted me the day we've started talking and sure nako talaga na mananatili nako sayo kase in my mind, we're already old and married and have grandchildren and living out the rest of our days in happines. \n\nI appreciate you so much Rei! I'm really glad that Venus brought us together that New Year's day. Because on that day, nakilala ko yung tahanan ko. You're my greatest plot twist but at the same time, you feel like the woman I've always been meant for. Oh god, I'm gonna marry you. \n\n(P.S. sana nagets mo AHAHAHHAHA)\n\n\n","title":"April 7, 2024","userEditedTimestampUsec":1712472641281000,"createdTimestampUsec":1712471659282000,"textContentHtml":"<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height:1.38;margin-top:0.0pt;margin-bottom:0.0pt;\"><span style=\"font-size:16.0pt;font-family:'Google Sans';color:#000000;background-color:transparent;font-weight:400;font-style:normal;font-variant:normal;text-decoration:none;vertical-align:baseline;white-space:pre;white-space:pre-wrap;\">---1/∞---<\/span><\/p><br /><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height:1.38;margin-top:0.0pt;margin-bottom:0.0pt;\"><span style=\"font-size:16.0pt;font-family:'Google Sans';color:#000000;background-color:transparent;font-weight:400;font-style:normal;font-variant:normal;text-decoration:none;vertical-align:baseline;white-space:pre;white-space:pre-wrap;\">Happy 1st Monthsary Bbycakes!
