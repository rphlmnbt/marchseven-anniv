You really turned my life upside down and I could no longer remember what life was like before you! Everyday, I wake up with a smile knowing that you're here for me every time. The past year has proved to me just how reliable and supportive you are of me. Masaya man ako o malungkot, may problema man o wala, may pangkape man o wala, you've been the one constant in my life that I could always rely on. You even support my number one hobby: expensive cardboard. AHAHAHHA MWAA BBY! I love you so much!! This will be the first of many!! May 60 years pa tayo nu ka ba!\n\nI also want to thank you for how appreciative you are of me, how grateful you are whenever I do stuff for you because it really makes me feel so loved. Tapos napakaunderstanding mo pa, di ka naiinis saken lalo na pag nagiging anxious or insecure ako huhuhu. You never make me feel judged and you always make me feel understood and loved. Thank you so much my bby huhu. I hope I make you feel the same! Last year hanggang ngayon, I always try to be perfect for you because you deserve nothing but the best! Pinapahalagahan kita ng sobra kaya I always want to put my best feet forward when it comes to you! Gusto ko lagi kang nakasmile kase nag cute cute ng bby ko na yan pag nakasmile siya! Kiss ko cheekies na yan!! MWAAA\n\nSana nagustuhan mo gift ko sayo! Hehehe eto talaga dahilan bat di ako naglaro last tuesday AHAHAHAH NEED KO TAPUSIN TO!! Ginawan na kita ng virtual letter compendium para mababasa mo sila in a cute way! Oh haaa, unpacking theme pa! Pak!
