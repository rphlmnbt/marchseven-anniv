I really find those messages of yours heartwarming and cute and sweet and it just makes the butterflies in my stomach flutter. \n\nBut really though, you're the real superhero. You're the real deal. You have a very very hard and tiring job and you tough it out every single day. You save lives Rei.

Kase character trait mo na yon, yoko nakawin AHAHAHAHA. Sayo lang dapat yon hahaha. It's one of the things that I'll always like about you. \n\nPero just this one time, save the world, Rei!
